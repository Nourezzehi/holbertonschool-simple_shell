How to use the Simple Shell:
You must first compile all the .c files in the repository to produce an executable using this code:

gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh
Then run the executable (shown on the first line of the example) to get into the custom shell:
$./hsh

 How our simple shell works :
It consists of a an infinite loop that is only interrupted by reaching End of File (EOF) or pressing exit . it follows the following steps :

Reads the command(s) from the standard Input.
Parses the command(s).
Executes the command (s) which takes few other important steps:
search the command in the environment.
search for the path.
create the child process to execute the command.
Free the allocated memory && the command output.
Go back to the begining of the infinite loop and print a prompt .

ðŸ“‘ Files Architecture:
-  main.h : Header file containing all functions prototypes and included header files. 
-  mainshell.c : contains the function calls contributing the shell work. 
-  get_the_line.c : gets the user input from the standard input.
-  parse_the_line.c : takes the line of command and divides it.
- env.c : gets and prints the environment.
-  shell.c : contains the checks before executing the main program.
- AUTHORS : file containing authors' names and their github usernames.
